FORMULA 1 TELEMETRY ANALYSIS — Driver Performance Deep Dive
===========================================================

> A data analytics project focused on decoding Formula 1 race telemetry to understand real driver behavior, car response, and performance patterns — using raw sensor data, not simulations.

This project is **not about prediction or machine learning**.  
It is about **reading, cleaning, and interpreting real-world time-series data** generated by an F1 car at race pace.

What This Project Is
--------------------

*   A **data analytics project**, end-to-end  
*   Uses **live motorsport telemetry APIs**  
*   Built entirely in **Python**
*   Focused on **data wrangling, time-series analysis, and interpretation**
*   Converts noisy sensor data into **human-understandable insights**
*   Includes a written **analysis & interpretation report**
*   Built, debugged, questioned, and validated step-by-step by me

Dataset & Source
----------------

*   **2024 Australian Grand Prix — Race Session**
*   Data fetched using the **FastF1 API**
*   Telemetry sourced from:
    * Car IoT sensors
    * FIA timing systems

This includes high-frequency measurements such as:
* Speed
* RPM
* Throttle position
* Brake usage
* Gear changes
* DRS activation
* Spatial coordinates (X, Y, Z)

Scope of Analysis
-----------------

To ensure depth over noise, the analysis focuses on:

*   A **single driver**
*   A **single stint**
*   Multiple laps under consistent conditions

> One thing, done properly — instead of everything, done shallowly.

This allows meaningful interpretation of **driver inputs**, **car response**, and **track behavior**.

Understanding Telemetry (Conceptual Model)
-------------------------------------------

Telemetry in this project is interpreted as:

### Driver Inputs
* Throttle
* Brake
* Gear
* DRS

### Car Outputs
* Speed
* RPM
* Acceleration
* Jerk

### Temporal Context
* Time
* SessionTime
* LapNumber

### Spatial Context
* Distance
* RelativeDistance
* X, Y, Z coordinates

Together, these explain **what the driver did**, **how the car reacted**, and **where it happened**.

Feature Engineering & Metrics
-----------------------------

Raw telemetry is cleaned and transformed into analytical signals such as:

* Speed (m/s)
* Acceleration
* Jerk (rate of change of acceleration)
* Speed deltas
* Braking events
* Throttle zones (Low / Medium / High)
* Gear change detection
* Throttle–Brake overlap
* Engine load proxy (RPM × Throttle)

> These are not textbook formulas — they are **practical proxy metrics** designed for interpretability.

Lap-Level Aggregation
---------------------

Telemetry is summarized **per lap** to study performance trends over time:

* Mean speed
* Total braking events
* Average throttle usage
* Average acceleration
* Time span per lap

This bridges **high-frequency sensor data** with **strategic race-level understanding**.
